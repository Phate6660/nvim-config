### Description ###
My nvim configuration, done in pure lua.
For screenshots, take a look at the screenshots/ directory.

### Requires ###
- paq-nvim to be installed -- https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim
- the latest neovim with treesitter and builtin LSP
- LSP servers (you'll need to remove the LSP servers you don't want in packages.lua):
  + bashls (bash)
  + deno (javascript and typescript)
  + fsautocomplete (fsharp)
  + intelephense (php)
  + rust_analyzer (rust)
  + sumneko (lua) -- make sure to change the paths to the correct ones if you use this
  + pyls (python)
- a terminal with truecolor support (I use xterm personally, it also has superb mouse support)

### Installation ###
- git clone https://github.com/Phate6660/nvim-config
- cp nvim-config/*.lua ~/.config/nvim (make ~/.config/nvim if it doesn't exit)
- edit ~/.config/nvim/init.lua and change CONFIG_PATH to your ~/.config/nvim directory

Note: The first time you run nvim after copying and editing the configs, 
you'll get errors about not being able to load Lua files.

### The Package Manager ###

This is because I use paq, a pure lua package manager which will handle installing
packages for you. To fix this, all you need to do is run :PaqInstall which automatically
clone all the repos specified. After that, just close nvim and re-open it.

Some notable other paq commands are:
- :PaqUpdate -- update packages
- :PaqList   -- list packages

Current package list:
  fennel.vim
  firenvim
  globedit.vim
  indent-guides.nvim
  lualine.nvim
  mkdir.nvim
  neon
  nvim-compe
  nvim-lspconfig
  nvim-luapad
  nvim-treesitter
  paq-nvim
  playground
  plenary.nvim
  popup.nvim
  rust.vim
  syntastic
  telescope.nvim

If you don't want any of the above packages, simply remove them from packages.lua.
Most of the pacakges are commented in the file with descriptions.

### Keybindings ###
\ + f       = manage files starting from current working directory with telescope
\ + t       = toggle a floating terminal running bash
\ + <space> = manage buffers with telescope
