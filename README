My nvim configuration, done in pure lua.
Requires:
- the latest neovim with treesitter and builtin LSP
- LSP servers (you'll need to remove the LSP servers you don't want in `packages.lua`):
  + bashls (bash)
  + deno (javascript and typescript)
  + fsautocomplete (fsharp)
  + intelephense (php)
  + rust_analyzer (rust)
  + sumneko (lua) -- make sure to change the paths to the correct ones if you use this
  + pyls (python)
- a terminal with truecolor support (I use xterm personally, it also has superb mouse support)

For screenshots, take a look at the `screenshots/` directory.

Installation:
- `git clone https://github.com/Phate6660/nvim-config`
- `cp nvim-config/*.lua ~/.config/nvim` (make `~/.config/nvim` if it doesn't exit)
- edit `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` and change `CONFIG_PATH` to your `~/.config/nvim` directory
